# observable todo list:
- conversion to const T
- different assignment strategies
    - move without observers reset
    - assign different observable without observers reset (might be immossible)
    - maybe more = figure out the requirements
- mutex customization point for link, callback_store, basic_obe
- reduce the weight and optimize
